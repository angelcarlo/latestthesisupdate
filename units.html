		  <p align="justify">
       
		  Originally a part of the Office of Student Welfare and Services, the Admission Section was created in 2004, to take charge of the administration and scoring of Entrance Examination. The computer- assisted entrance examination was constructed by the College of Computer Studies and proctored by Mr. Eduardo Mabita Jr. and Ms. Celina Ednave who were the first coordinators of the Admission Office. The computer assisted entrance examination consists of the following:
	<br />
	<br />
a.	General Information <br />
b.	Grammar <br />
c.	Mathematics <br />
d.	Science 
<br />
<br />
	The result of the examination served as the basis of student’s admission in the College and scholarship evaluation.
<br />
	In 2008, the admission office headed by Mr. Eduardo Mabita Jr. and Ms. Lawrence Lubong proposed and recommended in purchasing a new set of Standardized Psychological Test. The recommendation was given to Ms. Celina Ednave, the officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Student Welfare and Services. CFIT3 and OASIS- Aptitude Survey were used as tools to determine student’s admission in Gordon College.
<br />
	In 2011, Mrs. Herminia Magrata was designated in the Admission Office to help administering and interpreting scores for CFIT 3 and OASIS. Career Guidance and Counseling were given to students who have a problem of identifying what they need to pursue for College.
<br />
	In 2014, Mr. Raymond Q. Malibiran, accepted the offer to head the Admission Office.  Admission procedures were revised for more systematic measures.  In the same year, Ms. Evelyn Fabunan was also designated at the Admission Office for more efficient services that will cater students who wanted to enroll at Gordon College.
<br />	
	As of present time, the office continues to use such instrument in the Administration of Entrance Examination and the result of which are interpreted individually to the student- individual. In terms of recruitment and strengthening the quality of services, the Office of the Admission conducts career guidance to private and public schools within the Region. This is to promote good quality of education that the institution has to offer.
